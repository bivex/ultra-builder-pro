## Migration from Old Skills

This skill replaces:

### From ultra-file-router
- ✅ File size detection (preserved)
- ✅ 3-tier routing (preserved)
- ✅ Explicit Serena commands (preserved)
- ✅ BLOCK mechanism for >8K lines (preserved)

### From ultra-serena-advisor
- ✅ Task type analysis (preserved)
- ✅ Operation-based routing (preserved)
- ✅ Safety enforcement (preserved)
- ✅ Decision matrix (preserved)

### Improvements
- Unified routing logic (no conflicts)
- Eliminated duplicate Serena examples (~300 tokens saved)
- Clearer trigger conditions
- Single source of truth

**Remember**: This skill provides intelligent routing, not execution. User must explicitly invoke Serena commands. All user-facing messages are in Chinese at runtime.
